# 3D Object Viewer

## Overview

This GitHub project is a desktop application designed for viewing 3D objects in the OBJ format. The application provides a user-friendly interface allowing users to manipulate objects by rotating, tilting, and shifting them along three axes, as well as zooming in. Users can choose to render objects using lines and/or dots, with options for solid, dotted, or no lines, and square, circular, or no dots. Additionally, users can customize the colors of lines and dots. The application also supports capturing screenshots and recording GIFs of objects.
